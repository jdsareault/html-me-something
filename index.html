            <p id="intro">The following is a brief account of a trip that I took to Europe.

            <p class="storytext">In April of 2016, I took a two-week long vacation to France and
                the United Kingdom. It was my time traveling to Europe for
                an extended period of time.</p>

                <img src="images/paris.jpg" >
                <p class="storytext">We flew from Boston into Paris, France. We ate dinner at the
                    art at the Louvre. We also explored the catacombs beneath
                    Eiffel Tower, biked around the city, and saw famous works of
                    the city and had a picnic on the bank of the Seine.</p>
                <img src="images/beaune.jpg" >
                <p class="storytext">We rented a car and drove down to Beaune. We toured the
                    historic Hotel Dieu and tasted some of Burgandy's
                    finest wines.</p>
                <img src="images/castles.jpg" >
                <p class="storytext">We then drove north to the Loire valley. We stopped at
                    villages along the way, discovering many mid&#230;val
                    castles (and one replica being built!)</p>
                <img src="images/normandy1.jpg" >
                <p class="storytext">Next we stopped at Mont St. Michel, an abbey built on a small
                    island that connects with the mainland at low tide. A
                    little further north, we saw the Tapestry of Bayeux, which
                    details William the Conquerer's invasion of England in
                    1066 AD.</p>
                <img src="images/normandy2.jpg" >
                <p class="storytext">The most powerful part of the trip was when we visited the
                    sites of the 1944 Allied Forces invasion of Normandy. Many
                    beaches and hillsides still bear the scars of war, more
                    than half a centry later.</p>
                <img src="images/london.jpg" >
                <p class="storytext">We concluded our trip with a few days in London. We toured
                    Parliament and the Tower of London, saw a series of short
                    films inspired by Shakespeare, and explored some old world
                    pubs. We even saw a festival on St. George's Day and the
                    end of the London marathon!</p>

                <p class="storytext">This trip to Europe was a fantastic vacation! I can't wait
                    to plan my next adventure. The only question is... where
                    to next?</p>
